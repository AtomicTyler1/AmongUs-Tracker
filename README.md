# Journal-AmongUs [REACTOR MOD]

## DISCLAIMER: OPENS *localhost:8080*. May break with modded colors, I couldn't get a stable version while trying to do dynamic coloring.

Do you struggle to keep track of crewmates?

Well, you're in luck! I made this mod to keep track of crewmates (OR imposters) too!
This also works well with imposters as you can keep track of who's been hard cleared and slowly kill them off.

This mod creates a local host on port `:8080`, so if you have any other localhosts running, closing them down would probably be a good idea.
